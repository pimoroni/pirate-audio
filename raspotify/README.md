# Pirate Audio Raspotify/Spotify Connect Setup

Note: This software is currently in beta and subject to change. Hopefully we'll have an easy installer ready soon, but in the mean time read-on if you want to be an early adopter.

## Installing

Album art and track information display is supported on Pirate Audio boards using (Raspotify)[https://github.com/dtcooper/raspotify] and (PiDi Spotify)[https://github.com/pimoroni/pidi-spotify].

Currently it's not possible to control Spotify.

This is beta software that uses librespotify's `--onevent` hook to push information to the display.
